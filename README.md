# Raspy-Arch

An individual arch project using [Raspy control](https://github.com/ArkciaDragone/Raspy).

## Developing Environment

Python 3.7.3 (64-bit)

## Important Note

1. The programs are designed to run in Visual Studio Code. Direct double-click in the files' explorer is executable, but may cause unknown trouble.

2. All inputs in this project, unlike the music project in Raspy, should be done in the python command line, instead of the game chat.

3. Your location is grabbed as soon as you initialize the program (by inputing your name), so moving in-game after initializing should be avoided.

## Developer

[Howard C.](https://github.com/Howard-C), a co-developer of the main Raspy project.
