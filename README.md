# Raspy-Arch

An individual arch project using [Raspy control](https://github.com/ArkciaDragone/Raspy). Use it to quickly generate useful structures or beautiful architectures in Minecraft!

## Developing Environment

Python 3.7.3 (64-bit)

Visual Studio Code 1.38.1

## Running

- Startup a local Minecraft server and Minecraft 1.12.2.

- Enter multiplayer mode and select your server.

- Double-click on any of the files in the arch folder to start generating! A channel between the program and Minecraft will automatically be set up.

## Important Note

- The programs are designed to run in Visual Studio Code. Direct double-click in the files' explorer is executable, but may cause unknown trouble (which, although, is _very_ unlikely).

- All inputs in this project, unlike the music project in Raspy, should be done in the python command line, instead of the game chat.

- Your location is grabbed as soon as you initialize the program (by inputing your name), so moving in-game after initializing should be avoided.

## Developer
